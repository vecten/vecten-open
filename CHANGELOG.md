# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); in the 0.x series a minor release may break.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `build_sync_dag` takes `stages` (objects that run in a declared order, each stage once the
  one before it synced), `params` (run parameters passed to the connector's `source()`),
  `pool`, `guard` (a function whose falsy return skips the run without failing it),
  `timezone` (the zone a cron schedule is read in) and `paused_at_creation`. A DAG file that
  passes none of them behaves as before.
- An extension connector's declaration takes `groups`: each group's objects, cron `schedule`
  and `timezone`. `connector add` renders one sync DAG per group on its own schedule; an
  extension that declares no groups still gets the one `default` group on `@daily`.
- `dbt_build` has run parameters `select`, `exclude` and `full_refresh` for a manual run, and
  `build_dbt_dag` takes their defaults, `trigger="any"` (build when any awaited group updated
  rather than all of them) and `paused_at_creation`; `dbt_assets(config, groups)` narrows the
  awaited groups. A green build emits the `dbt_build` asset (`vecten://dbt/build`). A
  narrowed build skips `mark_built`, so the built commit still means the whole bundle built.

### Changed

- The `connector` skill names the `build_sync_dag` option for each scheduling request, and says
  that a new sync DAG syncs the latest whole day as soon as it is unpaused rather than at the
  next midnight.

### Fixed

- A sync DAG no longer publishes its asset when an object failed, so `dbt_build` no longer
  builds on a partial sync. The asset now follows the `check` task, and existing DAG files
  pick this up unchanged.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-09

The first public release.

- The `vecten` CLI over two components: `platform` (dlt ingestion, Apache Airflow
  orchestration, dbt modelling to schema convention 1, an Apache Ossie semantic model) and
  `mcp` (the Model Context Protocol server over the warehouse, with one warehouse identity per
  person, an audit with receipts, usage analytics and the feedback loop).
- Deploys to AWS and Scaleway with Postgres or Snowflake, through GitHub Actions and
  Terraform; runs on a laptop with Docker.
- Five agent skills (`guide`, `connector`, `model`, `semantic`, `operate`), shipped in the
  package, vendored into every project and published as a Claude Code plugin, with their
  evaluations.
- Published as `vecten`, `vecten-platform`, `vecten-mcp` and `vecten-shared` on PyPI and as
  `ghcr.io/vecten/vecten-airflow` and `ghcr.io/vecten/vecten-mcp`.
