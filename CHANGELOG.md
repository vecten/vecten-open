## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Analytics apps ([#39](https://github.com/vecten/vecten-open/issues/39)): an extension declares
  a dashboard in the `vecten.apps` group and a project binds it to MCP groups in
  `[apps.<extension>.<app>]`. A `container` app (Streamlit through `runtime = "streamlit"`, or
  any command and port) runs as a service on its own hostname. It reads data through the MCP as
  its app principal `svc_app_<app>`, with the roles of the groups the app admits only, held to
  its declared datasets in `describe`, `search`, `query_metrics` and `sql-exec`, which accepts
  only those datasets' tables and a list of reporting functions per warehouse. A bound group
  that cannot read every declared dataset admits no one and is reported in access health and
  `vecten issues`; the viewer passed in `X-Vecten-On-Behalf-Of` is recorded in the audit.
  `vecten app connect <extension>.<app> --env <env>` creates or rotates the principal and stores
  its credentials where the app's host reads them; `--groups-only` follows a binding change
  without rotating. The admin panel's Analytics screen, `GET /api/admin/apps`, the `list_apps`
  tool and the `/apps` page list the apps. Every viewer of one app sees the same data. The gate
  in front of an app's hostname and publishing a `snowflake` app come later; a laptop app reads
  no data. See [analytics apps](docs/analytics-apps.md).
- In-repo extensions: an extension package kept in the project under `extensions/<name>/`,
  registered with `vecten extension add ./extensions/<name>`, locked with its third-party
  dependencies only, installed editable in the CLI's environment and built from the bundle on
  every host. `vecten extension new <name> [--template <dir or git+https://…@<ref>>]` creates
  one from a template or the built-in skeleton, once.
- `vecten lock` writes `requirements.txt` (one pin per extension), one lock per component and
  `extensions.lock.json` together. An extension's `platform`, `mcp` and `cli` extras install
  only in that component, and `[dependencies.platform|mcp|cli] python` in `vecten.toml` adds a
  project's own packages to one component. Each lock records a hash of its inputs, which `up`
  and the bundle build check, naming `vecten lock` when stale; re-locking keeps existing pins,
  and `--upgrade <package>` moves one. `extension add` locks the same way, and `connector add`
  re-locks a project that already has locks ([#50](https://github.com/vecten/vecten-open/issues/50)).
- `[dependencies.platform] system` and `[dependencies.mcp] system` in `vecten.toml` install
  Debian packages into that image's project layer, as root before the Python packages, leaving
  no apt lists and returning to the image's user. Entries are validated as package names
  ([#50](https://github.com/vecten/vecten-open/issues/50)).
- Any extension can declare the secrets it reads and a schema for its settings in a
  `vecten.manifest` entry point; a project declares its own in `vecten.toml` (`secrets`,
  `[settings.project]`). A secret's prefix decides where it is delivered (`MCP_` names to the
  MCP server, others to Airflow), the same way on the laptop and on every VM. Settings live in
  `[settings.<extension>]` with `env.<env>` overrides, are checked against the schema by
  `vecten lock`, `up`, `ship` and the MCP server's startup, and are read, with declared secrets,
  through `vecten_shared.context` ([#49](https://github.com/vecten/vecten-open/issues/49)).
- Extension services: an extension declares a long-running process and its HTTP routes in a
  `vecten.services` entry point, `vecten lock` records it in `extensions.lock.json`, and the
  project binds it in `[services.<extension>.<service>]` of `vecten.toml` (hostname, host,
  limits, and each route's `public` or `login` access, `groups` and `allow`); `extension add`
  writes the binding from the extension's suggestions and names every public route. A bound
  service runs from its host component's project image on the deployed host and under
  `vecten up` (at `https://<label>.localhost:8443`, unless `local = false`), on its own Docker
  network that only NGINX joins, with memory and CPU limits, an optional host-local volume, no
  cloud credentials (the VM agent blocks the metadata address, at boot too, through
  `vecten-services-guard.service`) and only the secrets its extension declares. Each routed
  service gets its own hostname: `vecten deploy` creates the DNS record on AWS and Scaleway, the
  next ship its certificate, and NGINX serves only the bound paths, clearing the `X-Vecten-*`
  identity headers clients send. `login` routes sign people in through the MCP's gate and pass
  the service who they are in those headers. `ship` reports each service's health, the routes
  waiting for a deploy and the volumes of services a host no longer runs, and never rolls back
  for a service; `next` notes unbound services and offers the deploy a new hostname needs. A
  project without services renders and deploys exactly as before; one that binds a hostname
  runs `vecten update` first. See [extension services](docs/services.md)
  ([#38](https://github.com/vecten/vecten-open/issues/38)).
- Deployed hosts: `dags_paused_at_creation = true` in `deploy/envs/<env>.tfvars` makes that
  environment's new DAGs start paused, `[airflow] allow` in `vecten.toml` limits which networks
  reach `airflow.<domain>` (Airflow's health path stays open for `vecten ship`), and
  `root_volume_size_gb` in the tfvars sizes every VM's root volume on AWS and Scaleway. Every
  default is the current behaviour.
- `build_sync_dag` takes `stages` (objects that run in a declared order, each stage once the
  one before it synced), `params` (run parameters passed to the connector's `source()`),
  `pool`, `guard` (a function whose falsy return skips the run without failing it),
  `timezone` (the zone a cron schedule is read in) and `paused_at_creation`. A DAG file that
  passes none of them behaves as before.
- An extension connector's declaration takes `groups`: each group's objects, cron `schedule`
  and `timezone`. `connector add` renders one sync DAG per group on its own schedule; an
  extension that declares no groups still gets the one `default` group on `@daily`.
- `dbt_build` has run parameters `select`, `exclude` and `full_refresh` for a manual run, and
  `build_dbt_dag` takes their defaults, `trigger="any"` (build when any awaited group updated
  rather than all of them) and `paused_at_creation`; `dbt_assets(config, groups)` narrows the
  awaited groups. A green build emits the `dbt_build` asset (`vecten://dbt/build`). A
  narrowed build skips `mark_built`, so the built commit still means the whole bundle built.
- A project lists its own dbt packages in `dbt/project-packages.yml`: dbt hub packages pinned
  to one release and public git repositories pinned to a full commit id. `vecten dbt`,
  `vecten dbt-build-local` and the dbt DAG's `deps` task append them to the generated
  `dbt/packages.yml`, and the file ships in the bundle. An unpinned, private, local or tarball
  entry, a duplicate, or one named like a generated entry exits 6 before dbt runs. A deployed
  host needs outbound HTTPS to `hub.getdbt.com` and GitHub, which both clouds' hosts already
  have.
- `vecten dbt --env <env> <args>` runs dbt against a deployed environment's Snowflake warehouse
  as its `LOADER` user, with the key from that environment's secrets store passed to dbt
  through its process environment only. On `prod` only commands that build nothing run
  (`compile`, `test`, `ls`, `show`, `debug`, `parse`, `source freshness`, `docs generate`,
  `deps`, `clean`, `docs serve`). `test` leaves out unit tests and refuses `--store-failures`,
  and `test` and `source freshness` are refused while the project declares on-run hooks or a
  test stores its failures. Every command runs on other environments. A Postgres project is
  refused, because its deployed warehouse is on a private network.

### Changed

- `requirements.txt` holds only extension pins after the first `vecten lock`; connector
  dependencies live in the locks. Locks written by an earlier release keep building until then.
- The `connector` skill names the `build_sync_dag` option for each scheduling request, and says
  that a new sync DAG syncs the latest whole day as soon as it is unpaused rather than at the
  next midnight.
- `vecten dbt` on a Snowflake project without `--env` now names `--env` alongside
  `vecten dbt-build-local` in its refusal.

### Fixed

- `--env <env>` commands that reach or name the MCP (`vecten login`, `user`, `group`, `grant`,
  `issues`, `mcp admin-link`, `mcp connection`, `mcp provisioner-script` and the sign-in items
  of `next`) use the environment's own domain from `deploy/envs/<env>.tfvars`, not prod's
  `[deploy] domain` ([#36](https://github.com/vecten/vecten-open/issues/36)).
- A sync DAG no longer publishes its asset when an object failed, so `dbt_build` no longer
  builds on a partial sync. The asset now follows the `check` task, and existing DAG files
  pick this up unchanged.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-09

The first public release.

- The `vecten` CLI over two components: `platform` (dlt ingestion, Apache Airflow
  orchestration, dbt modelling to schema convention 1, an Apache Ossie semantic model) and
  `mcp` (the Model Context Protocol server over the warehouse, with one warehouse identity per
  person, an audit with receipts, usage analytics and the feedback loop).
- Deploys to AWS and Scaleway with Postgres or Snowflake, through GitHub Actions and
  Terraform; runs on a laptop with Docker.
- Five agent skills (`guide`, `connector`, `model`, `semantic`, `operate`), shipped in the
  package, vendored into every project and published as a Claude Code plugin, with their
  evaluations.
- Published as `vecten`, `vecten-platform`, `vecten-mcp` and `vecten-shared` on PyPI and as
  `ghcr.io/vecten/vecten-airflow` and `ghcr.io/vecten/vecten-mcp`.
